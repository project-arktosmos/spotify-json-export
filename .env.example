# Spotify API credentials
# Get these from https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id_here

# Optional: Override the redirect URI (defaults to http://127.0.0.1:1998/api/spotify/callback)
# For production (GitHub Pages), this is set automatically by the CI workflow
# VITE_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=https://yourusername.github.io/repo-name/api/spotify/callback

# Note: SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET is not needed - this app uses PKCE flow (client-side only)
